# Deep-Learning-Project: DiffusionTunes: Long-Form Music Generation viaDual Conditioning

This is the codebase for our Deep Learning project titled "DiffusionTunes: Long-Form Music Generation via Dual Conditioning". The project explores the use of diffusion models for generating long-form music compositions. This repo contains three branches: 
1. **main**: This branch contains the introduction.
2. **stage1_2**: This branch contains the code for the first two stages of the project, including data preprocessing and diffusion model training.
3. **demo**: This branch contains the code for the other stages, evaluation, and demo.
